This project simulates and compares momentum and mean reversion strategies by backtesting them with stock price data gathered by yfinance.

Strategies I compared:
1. Momentum: Buying top stocks by 3-month return.
2. Mean Reversion: Buying worst stocks by 3-month return.
In this project, I bought the 2 top/worst stocks for each strategy.
